# Boone Area Climbing Map

**Overview** <br>
--
_This map provides the user with the ability to navigate to Boones primary bouldering locations using the starting point of Center 45. The user can select from the drop down on the top right of the page which area they wish to go to. Upon selecting their destination, a road map will highlight to optimal driving route, in addtion the user can click on the path to get a general driving direction guide._<br>

<p>_Once the user has chosen where they want to drive to they can double click on the drop pin of their destination and the map will zoom in to show the walking directions for the climbing area. In this new zoomed in view there will be pins associated with each boulder located at the area. Clicking on the pin will zoom you in further as well as show each climb at that area. In addition to giving the climbing names almost every climb has a link that shows a beta video associated with it._<br> 

**Reasoning**<br>
--
<p>_There is a lack of climbing information for the Boone area which leads to a lot of missinformation of where climbs are located, the grades of climbs, and if the climb has already been astablished. By providing information about the climbs it allows for a larger share of information and will beneift climbers and developers._</p>
</br>
**Libraries**
--
_leaflet and jquery were the libraries used to display this information_
